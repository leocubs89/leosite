                            <p> An exponent decides how many times you multiply a number or expression by itself.  </p>

                            <p>    As you can see in the first example the exponent is 2. This means we multiply by 2, twice!  </p>
                            <p>    In the second example the exponent is 3. This means we multiply by 2, three times.  </p>

                            <p>Using our examples from above what do you think the answer would be to 2^1?</p>
                            <p>If you follow the pattern above, you will get: 2^1 = 2 = 2</p>
                            <p>Easy enough, right?(:</p>

                            <p>In this scenario would be having an exponent of 0. For example: 2^0=1.</p>
                            <p>Now this might not work using the patterns from above but what if we rewrite our first example as: 2^2 = 1 ∙ 2 ∙2 = 4</p>
                            <p>Now following this pattern, 2^0=1 Makes sense. In fact any number or expression with an exponent of 0 will always be 1.</p>

                            <p>If we have a negative exponent then there is only one thing we need to do differently and that is to put the number or expression in the denominator.</p>
                            <p>for example:  2^(-2)  =1/(2^2)   from here we can use the same patterns used above to find 2^(-2) = 1/(2^2) = 1/(1 ∙ 2 ∙ 2) = 1/4 </p>

                            <p>fractional exponents are another story. If you have an exponent with a number in the denominator like here: 2^(1/2) then this the 2nd root of 2: 2^(1/2)= √2.</p> 
                            <p>if we have 2^(1/3), then we can see the 3 in the denominator and know this is the 3rd root of 2: 2^(1/3)= ∛2</p>
                            <p>this goes on and on for all numbers.</p>

                            <p>Putting them all together we can get something crazy like: 4^(-3/2). This can seem like a lot at first but using what we know from above, we can solve it!</p> 
                            <p>The best part about the rules from above is that we can apply them in any order. Lets deal with the negative sign first.</p>
                            <p>This means we must move the expression into the denominator like so: 4^(-3/2)=  1/(4^(3/2)) </p>
                            <p> Next we can deal with the 2 in the denominator in our exponent. </p>
                            <p>This means we take the 2nd root of our expression giving us: 4^(-3/2) =  1/(4^(3/2)) =1/(√(4)^3) </p>
                            <p>Solving √(4)=2: we get 4^(-3/2 )=  1/(4^(3/2)) = 1/(√(4)^3) =  1/(2^3) </p>
                            <p>Last step is to deal with our exponent of 3 using the first example we saw:  where 2^3= 1∙ 2 ∙2 ∙2=8 </p>
                            <p>Finally giving us 4^(-3/2)=  1⁄4^(3/2) =1⁄〖√(2&4)〗^3 =  1⁄2^3 =1⁄( 1∙ 2 ∙2 ∙2=1⁄8)</p>
                            <p>I encourage you to try this problem by doing the steps in a different order and see if you get the same answer. Hint: you will!</p>
